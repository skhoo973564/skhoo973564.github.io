    <p>yes, you heard it right, snails do sleep and guess what?<br>
    they can sleep for 3 years!! yes! 3 years, now your probably<br>
    wondering "don't snails only <strong>live</strong> for like 2<br>
    weeks?" well your wrong <strong(bruh)</strong> they can live for<br>
    about 10-15 years which is a lot! now as i said, they do sleep for<br>
    3 years inside there shell, for <strong>maxmimum protection!</strong><br>
    except us humans can step on it and say "oopsie, didn't realise that"<br>
    but thats fine after all who cares about snails? (just kidding, please dont<br>
    sue me) but yes, they can have a higher chance of survival if they hide in<br>
    their shell, because 1. either danger or 2. because heat. (i don't know im pretty<br>
    bad at facts) So yes these are some facts about snails, and they are pretty cool...<br>
    oh yeah and next time you step on a sleeping snail, at least its fallen asleep.</p>

    <h1>topic: orange, sporange</h1>
  
    <p>ok so, have you seen a dictionary before? maybe you have but guess what, you might<br>
    think that they contain pretty much everything rhyming to each other but guess what?<br>
    Your wrong! because theres a popular world that doesnt rhyme and some of you may have<br>
    heard of it while some of you didn't and it is orange, purple, silver and month. yes<br>
    you heard me right... orange, now your probably thinking, "what about sporange? thats<br>
    a word isnt it?" well your wrong, (of course) like what even is a sporange? the closest<br>
    thing to a orange is sporangium or something i forgot, but something like that. Its not,<br>
    just orange, (as i said before, its orange, purple and silver) so next time you think you<br>
    can break the system of rhyming orange without a meaning to it, just imagine that your the<br>
    smart one.</p>
