    <p>yes, you heard it right, snails do sleep and guess what?
     they can sleep for 3 years!! yes! 3 years, now your probably
     wondering "don't snails only <strong>live</strong> for like 2
     weeks?" well your wrong <strong>(bruh)</strong> they can live for
     about 10-15 years which is a lot! now as i said, they do sleep for
     3 years inside there shell, for <strong>maxmimum protection!</strong>
     except us humans can step on it and say "oopsie, didn't realise that"
     but thats fine after all who cares about snails? (just kidding, please dont
     sue me) but yes, they can have a higher chance of survival if they hide in
     their shell, because 1. either danger or 2. because heat. (i don't know im pretty
     bad at facts) So yes these are some facts about snails, and they are pretty cool...
     oh yeah and next time you step on a sleeping snail, at least its fallen asleep.</p>

    <p>ok so, have you seen a dictionary before? maybe you have but guess what, you might
     think that they contain pretty much everything rhyming to each other but guess what?
     Your wrong! because theres a popular world that doesnt rhyme and some of you may have
     heard of it while some of you didn't and it is orange, purple, silver and month. yes
     you heard me right... orange, now your probably thinking, "what about sporange? thats
     a word isnt it?" well your wrong, (of course) like what even is a sporange? the closest
     thing to a orange is sporangium or something i forgot, but something like that. Its not,
     just orange, (as i said before, its orange, purple and silver) so next time you think you
     can break the system of rhyming orange without a meaning to it, just imagine that your the
     smart one.</p>
